    <h3>2. Appointment Scheduling and Access</h3>
    <p>Appointments for services are scheduled in advance and confirmed by our team. You agree to provide us access to your property at the agreed times for us to perform the services.

    <h3>4. Cancellation and Refund Policy</h3>
    <p>We require minimum 24 hours' notice for cancellations or rescheduling of appointments. Cancellations made after this period or failure to be present at the scheduled time may be subject to cancellation fees. Refunds for services already rendered will not be issued except in cases of clear failure to perform agreed services or as required by law. Custom work cancellations are subject to specific terms provided at the time of agreement.</p>

    <h3>5. Customer Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>Customers agree to provide accurate information about their property and needs. You must disclose any hazards or special considerations we should be aware of before service. You are responsible for lawn, plant, and property conditions, including irrigation systems and underground utilities.

If unresolved, disputes may be submitted to mediation, arbitration, or courts as appropriate.</p>

    <h3>12. Force Majeure</h3>
